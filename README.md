# Izanami-ALX

A small text based RPG I made in vim. You take on the role of  a lone adventurer thrust into the world of demons in search of a nameless sword.  

Has 4 endings that you unlock based on how much you talked to the NPCs.

Installation:
Note that this game requires the installation of Bash and runs in the terminal. You can find gitbash here https://git-scm.com/download/win

Simply run the ccc.sh file and save data will be created. if you want to restart, go to the folder and delete your "save.conf" file.
